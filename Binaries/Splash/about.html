        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>Horos is a free, open source medical image viewer.  The goal of the Horos Project is to develop a fully functional, 64-bit medical image viewer for OS X.  Horos is based upon OsiriX<sup>TM</sup> and other open source medical imaging libraries.  Horos is made available under the GNU Lesser General Public License, Version 3 (LGPL-3.0).</p>

        <h2>Origin of Our Name</h2>
        <p>In Egyptian Mythology, Horus was the “Son” of the god Osiris. However, upon Osiris’ death, his body was cut into pieces and spread across Egypt. Someone who loved Osiris dearly tried to reassemble his dismantled fragments but a part of him was missing and he was never the same again. Soon after, he had a son named Horus. And it was upon his son’s arrival that Osiris descended into the underworld to become god of the dead.</p>
        <p>We loved OsiriX<sup>TM</sup>, and like our Egyptian predecessors, we took it upon ourselves to reassemble the open source product from its broken pieces after its code base was closed. So we thought the name Horos was a particularly fitting tribute.</p>
